# Midterms-1st-Year
These are my java programs for my Midterms on November 2022!

# 1st Program = Attack Speed
This program calculates a character's attack speed by taking in the base attack speed, which it then multiplies to the sum of 1 + (bonus attack speed*(level-1)). A bunch of calculations but it gets a simple estimate of a character's current attack speed :D.

# 2nd Program = Male Female
The program calculates first how many students are in a class. It then calculates the percentage of Male Female ratio in that class using the total number of students.

# 3rd Program = Monthly Pay
The Monthly Pay program calculates how much the gross pay of an employee is deducted from various things such as Taxes, which then gives the result of an employee's actual monthly pay.
